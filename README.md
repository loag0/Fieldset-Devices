# FieldSet Devices

This was a school project where we had to design a website for a company of our choice — so I came up with **FieldSet Devices**, a fictional tech brand.

The focus was on layout, visuals, and interaction — no backend, just front-end work to showcase design and structure. Think of it more like a concept site or digital mockup rather than a full-blown application.
