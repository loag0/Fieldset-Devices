## 🎨 Design Goal

FieldSet Devices is a concept website created for a university project. We were tasked with designing a brand website for a fictional company of our choice — so I cooked up **FieldSet Devices**, a sleek, modern tech brand focused on futuristic innovation.

This project was all about front-end layout, visuals, and interactive UX — no backend, just clean code and design.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Fully responsive layout across devices
- 🎯 Strong visual branding and color schemes
- 🧭 Simple, scroll-friendly navigation
- 💡 Conceptual product cards, call-to-action sections, and a mock contact form
- 💻 Pure HTML/CSS with minimal JavaScript — lightweight and fast

## 🛠️ Built With

- **HTML5** — semantic structure  
- **CSS3** — custom styling and responsiveness  
- **JavaScript** — simple interactivity (nav toggles, etc.)

## 🔗 Live Site

## 🚀 Status

This project is complete as a visual concept. No backend or database is wired — it's a static site for UI/UX demonstration purposes only.

## 💡 Author Notes

This was one of my early explorations into full custom site design from scratch — no frameworks, just raw HTML/CSS. Learned a lot about responsive design and UI structure. Would I use Bootstrap now? Probably not 😅
